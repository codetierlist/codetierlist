docker swarm init # creates a swarm
docker swarm join-token worker # shows the command to join a worker to the swarm
docker swarm join-token manager # shows the command to join a manager to the swarm

docker service create --name registry --publish published=5000,target=5000 registry:2 # creates a registry service
docker service ls # lists all services

docker compose build # builds the images
docker compose push # pushes the images to the registry

docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml codetl # deploys the stack
docker stack services codetl # shows info about codetl

docker network create --driver overlay codetl-runner # creates a network for the runners




so maybe just run each runner on swarm, pipe in the data
